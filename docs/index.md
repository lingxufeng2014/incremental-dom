      Incremental DOM is a library for expressing and applying updates to DOM trees. JavaScript can be used to extract, iterate over and transform data into calls generating `HTMLElement`s and `Text` nodes. It differs from Virtual DOM approaches in that a diff operation is performed <em>incrementally</em> (that is one node at a time) against the DOM, rather than on a virtual DOM tree.

      Rather than targeting direct usage, Incremental DOM aims to provide a platform for higher level libraries or frameworks. As you might notice from the examples, Incremental DOM-style markup can be somewhat challenging to write and read. See [Why Incremental DOM](#why-incremental-dom) for an explanation.
